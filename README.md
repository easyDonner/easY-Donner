The Poolesville High School Team, “easY”, partnered with Oasis Farms to build a glove donner and doffer device. The ‘easY Glover’ device allows individuals with motor and mental disabilities to put on and take off gloves independently and efficiently. Volunteers at Oasis Farms have demonstrated improvements in time and reduced stress from helpers.
